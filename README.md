The Climate decision tree can be run by running the **decision_tree.py** script

The ipcc_climate_1985-2015.tif file required by the clim_zone_lookup.py script can be downloaded from the [IPCC page](https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/faq/faq.html?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR2LV1qs2EM5OvQS1A7uiDMuiPqK4dkhgkKbLMd57v4F8Ta2aJANqvC0OU0_aem_c33p3_HLQ6ke_dt85m505A)

This scripts do not currently pull live weather, temperature and precipitation data. Rather they use assumed values for the time being. This will be updated shortly.
