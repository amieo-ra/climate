The Climate decision tree can be run by running the **decision_tree.py** script

The ipcc_climate_1985-2015.tif file required by the clim_zone_lookup.py script can be downloaded from the [IPCC page](https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/faq/faq.html?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR2LV1qs2EM5OvQS1A7uiDMuiPqK4dkhgkKbLMd57v4F8Ta2aJANqvC0OU0_aem_c33p3_HLQ6ke_dt85m505A). The ipcc_climate_1985-2015.tif allows you to determine which climate zone you are in based on your coordinates.

This scripts do not currently pull live weather, temperature and precipitation data. Rather they use assumed values for the time being. This will be updated shortly.
